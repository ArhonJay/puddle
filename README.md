## 🎯 Key Features

### For LP Farmers (Pool Creators)
- Create customizable liquidity pools with 1-10 milestone zones
- Earn 0.3% trading fees on all transactions
- Track pool performance and statistics
- Claim accumulated fees anytime

### For Users (Stakers)
- **Stake anytime** - Buy USDT with STX in any active pool
- **Milestone-based exits** - Sell only when zones unlock
- **Progressive rewards** - Higher rewards for reaching higher milestones
  - Zone 1: 1.5x multiplier
  - Zone 2: 2.0x multiplier
  - Zone 3: 2.5x multiplier
  - And so on...
- **Transparent info** - View all pool data, estimates, and statistics

## 📊 System Architecture

```
LP Farmer → Creates Pool → Sets Milestones (Zones)
    ↓
Users Stake (Buy USDT with STX)
    ↓
Time Passes → Zones Unlock
    ↓
Users Unstake (Sell USDT) → Claim Rewards
    ↓
LP Farmer Claims Trading Fees
```

### Zone System
- Each pool has configurable zones (milestones)
- Zones lock users' funds until unlock time
- Users can only sell when zones are unlocked
- Higher zones = higher reward multipliers
- Creates commitment mechanism aligned with project goals

### 4. Run Tests

```bash
npm test
```

### 5. Interactive Development

```bash
clarinet console
```

Try these commands:
```clarity
;; Create a pool
(contract-call? .vault create-liquidity-pool u10000000 u10000000 u3 u144)

;; Check pool info
(contract-call? .vault get-pool-info u0)

;; Buy USDT (stake)
(contract-call? .vault buy-usdt u0 u1000000)
```

## 📖 Documentation Guide

| Document | Purpose | Read When... |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| **README.md** | Feature overview & API | You want to understand what the contract does |
| **ARCHITECTURE.md** | Technical deep-dive | You want to understand how it works internally |
| **DEPLOYMENT.md** | Deployment guide | You're ready to deploy to testnet/mainnet |
| **QUICK_REFERENCE.md** | Code examples | You need quick code samples |
| **DIAGRAMS.md** | Visual guides | You prefer visual explanations |
| **SUMMARY.md** | Complete summary | You want a high-level overview |

## 🔒 Security Features

✅ **Access Control**
- Only LP Farmers can claim pool fees
- Users can only sell their own positions
- Zone locks enforced at contract level

✅ **Input Validation**
- All amounts validated > 0
- Pool existence checks
- Balance sufficiency checks
- Zone configuration validation

✅ **Economic Security**
- AMM formula prevents manipulation
- Trading fees protect LP Farmers
- Progressive rewards incentivize commitment
- Transparent calculations

## 💰 Economics

### Trading Fees
- **0.3%** on every trade (30 basis points)
- 100% goes to LP Farmer
- Collected automatically

### Reward Formula
```
Base Reward = (User Contribution / Total Volume) * Pool Fees
Zone Multiplier = 1.0 + (Zone Number * 0.5)
Final Reward = Base Reward * Zone Multiplier
```

### Example
```
User stakes: 10 STX
Total volume: 100 STX
Pool fees: 0.3 STX
Zone 2 (multiplier: 2.0x)

Base reward: (10/100) * 0.3 = 0.03 STX
Final reward: 0.03 * 2.0 = 0.06 STX
```

## 🎮 Use Cases

### 1. **Project Milestone Funding**
Companies can create pools tied to quarterly or project milestones, ensuring stakeholder commitment aligned with project goals.

### 2. **Liquidity Mining Programs**
DeFi protocols can offer attractive progressive rewards to incentivize long-term liquidity provision.

### 3. **Commitment Savings**
Users can create personal saving goals with time-locked milestones and rewards for discipline.

### 4. **Crowdfunding with Accountability**
Startups can raise funds with milestone-based unlock mechanisms, giving investors exit options if milestones aren't met.

## ⭐ Highlights

### What Makes This Unique?

1. **Milestone-Based Commitment**: Unlike traditional liquidity pools, this system ties liquidity to project milestones, creating aligned incentives.

2. **Progressive Rewards**: Users who commit longer receive exponentially higher rewards, not just linear increases.

3. **LP Farmer Model**: Pool creators become active participants who earn from their pool's success.

4. **Time-Locked Zones**: Prevents immediate dumps while allowing planned exits at meaningful milestones.

5. **Transparent & Fair**: All calculations are on-chain, verifiable, and deterministic.
